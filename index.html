		                <p>At Bluedot we like to win. It is just that simple. The approach we take to training differs from a lot of firms that work
		                    in the field now.</br>
		                    </br>As well as helping craft and deliver content, we focus on the character of the people presenting.</br>
		                </p>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>How well do you deliver yourself in the room?</li>
		                    <li>How do we put the strengths of our team forward?</li>
		                </ul>
		                <p>We take a personal interest in the people presenting and how they act and react.</br>
		                    </br>It starts with research on who you are pitching and why are they interested in your services. Complete dossiers on the client
		                    and their interests allow us to tailor our approach to each presentation. It works and our track record proves it.</br>
		                    </br>We work with small groups and individuals; the principals of our firm do the work. Nothing is outsourced or diluted. And
		                    we donâ€™t pull punches, our job is to help you win the contract and that goal is paramount. In this tight economy, putting
		                    resources into presentation skills must have a return on investment. We like to win.</p>

						<p class="testimonial">It is with confidence that we introduce Bluedot Communications and their presentation training services. They have been
							involved in numerous training sessions with us over the past three years and their track record in that regard is outstanding.</br>
							</br>Bluedot has proved their worth on every occasion and boasts a remarkable 85% success rate in the jobs that we have used
							them for. Concentrating on character as well as content has allowed them to carve their own niche in the presentation industry,
							raising our own skills in the process. Intricate large public projects seem to be their sweet spot. Complete background research
							on the review panels and delivery of that to the presenting process has allowed us to concentrate on our ability to deliver
							with confidence.</br>
							</br>I am sure that they can help your firm in the delivery and completion of your next large project. Please donâ€™t hesitate
							to call if you have questions about our work together.</p>

						<p class="testimonial">It was great to meet you and to have the opportunity to benefit from your abundant experience and insight regarding our
							teamâ€™s presentation to the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium.</br>
							</br>As you know, our team was successful in our effort to secure this very important project, and while collectively have a
							lot of talent as presenters, we certainly benefited a great deal from your coaching. We owe you a lot of credit for our successful
							outcome. Iâ€™ve been making design presentations now for over 30 years. Over that time, worked with a lot of very good presenters,
							and have also attended several workshops tailored to the design industry for the purposes of improving presentations to clients
							and colleagues. I can say that I learned a great deal in the short time we spent together, and probably more than from all
							the other workshops combined.</br>
							</br>Your knowledge, insight, objectivity, and candor combined with wit and humor made for an exciting and effective process
							and outcome. Your passion for your work is evident and infectious, and for all these reasons, I whole-heartedly recommend
							you and the services of Bluedot to others. I look forward to more opportunities to work with you, and Iâ€™m happy that we were
							able to not only win this commission, but contribute to your already strong record for success!</p>

						<p class="testimonial">We needed a guy who understood the big picture â€” the appropriate beginning, middle and end for our production. John Mazzocco
							listened carefully to our plan, made smart suggestions, and then put his production experience and professional network into
							action. The result was an unforgettable evening of perfectly timed dining, speeches, fundraising and entertainment that struck
							the right beats at the right moments.</br>
							</br>Plan the work â€“ work the plan, but also be clever and confidant enough to improvise and take chances when necessary. Thatâ€™s
